# Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system based on TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

## Overview

The movie recommendation system suggests movies to users based on the similarity between movie descriptions and user preferences. It utilizes the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique to convert movie descriptions into numerical vectors and then computes the cosine similarity between these vectors to recommend similar movies.

## Features

- TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts movie descriptions into numerical vectors.
- Cosine Similarity Calculation: Measures the similarity between movie vectors.
- Python Implementation: Written in Python for ease of use and flexibility.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses movie data for better recommendation accuracy.
- User Interaction: Allows users to input preferences and receive movie recommendations.
- Web Scraping: Collects movie data from online sources (optional).
- Database Management: Stores and retrieves movie data efficiently (optional).
- Evaluation Metrics: Measures the performance of the recommendation system using metrics like precision and recall.
- Deployment and Integration: Easily deployable as a standalone application or integrate into existing platforms.

## Usage

To use the movie recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the movie dataset or scrape movie data from online sources (if necessary).
2. Preprocess the movie data to clean and format it appropriately.
3. Implement TF-IDF vectorization to convert movie descriptions into vectors.
4. Compute cosine similarity between movie vectors.
5. Input user preferences or select a user profile to generate movie recommendations.
6. Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate metrics.
7. Deploy the system as needed, either as a standalone application or integrate into existing platforms.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
